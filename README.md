###### 1. Two Number Sum
 
Write a function that takes in a non-empty array of distinct integers and an integer representing a target sum. If any two numbers in the input array sum up to the target sum, the function should return them in an array. If no two numbers sum up to the target sum, the function should return an empty array. Assume that there will be at most one pair of numbers summing up to the target sum.
 
Sample input: `[3, 5, -4, 8, 11, 1, -1, 6], 10`
 
Sample output: `[-1, 11]`
 
###### 2.
Create a simple react app using Typescript only functional programming (No Class or This keyword) that receive the sample input for the previous question (Two Number Sum) and after clicking in a Button it will request a backend for the response (sample output), the response should be shown on a modal with an OK button to dismiss. 
 
The app should handle all possible errors (connection, wrong input, and so on), and give the user a good overall experience.
